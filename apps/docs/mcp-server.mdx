description: How to use Ultracite's MCP server
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other AI-powered tools to securely connect with external data sources and systems. Ultracite provides an MCP server that gives AI assistants access to the Ultracite knowledge base.

## What It Provides

The Ultracite MCP server exposes a single tool:

- **`SearchUltracite`** — Search across the Ultracite knowledge base to find relevant information, code examples, API references, and guides. Use this tool when you need to answer questions about Ultracite, find specific documentation, understand how features work, or locate implementation details. The search returns contextual content with titles and direct links to the documentation pages.

## Installation

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Tool

Make sure you're using an AI development tool that supports MCP:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Windsurf by Codeium](https://windsurf.com/)
- Other MCP-compatible tools

### Step 2: Locate Your Configuration File

Depending on your AI tool, edit one of these files:

- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf**: `.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`

### Step 3: Add Ultracite Configuration

Add this to your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ultracite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://docs.ultracite.ai/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Restart Your AI Tool

Close and reopen your AI application for the changes to take effect.

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant about Ultracite:

> How does Ultracite work with Oxlint?

The AI will retrieve the relevant information from the Ultracite knowledge base and return it to you.

## Multiple MCP Servers

You can use Ultracite alongside other MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ultracite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://docs.ultracite.ai/mcp"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security and Privacy

- The Ultracite MCP server only provides public documentation
- No personal data or code is transmitted to our servers
- No authentication required
