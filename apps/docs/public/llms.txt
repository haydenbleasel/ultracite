# Ultracite

Ultracite is a zero-config preset for the Biome formatter/linter.  It packages an opinionated set of rules, editor integrations, and Git-hook helpers so JavaScript / TypeScript projects can adopt fast, consistent code quality checks without manually tuning every setting.  The site explains how to install Ultracite, tailor it when needed, and contribute to its open-source codebase.

## Introduction  
Gives a high-level picture of what Ultracite is and why it exists.  It contrasts Ultracite (a curated configuration) with Biome (the underlying engine) and tools like ESLint + Prettier, highlighting Biome’s Rust-powered speed and the “one tool, one config” philosophy.

## Setup  
Step-by-step installation instructions:

- **Automatic:** `npx ultracite init` installs Ultracite, Biome, VS Code settings, and optional Git-hook integrations in one command.  
- **Manual:** shows the exact `npm/yarn/pnpm` commands, the minimal `biome.jsonc` that must include `"extends": ["ultracite/biome/core"]`, and recommended `.vscode/settings.json` for on-save formatting.  
- Advises enabling `strictNullChecks` in `tsconfig.json` and installing the Biome VS Code extension.

- Configuration schema: `https://biomejs.dev/schemas/`  
- VS Code extension: marketplace link in page

## Usage  
Covers day-to-day workflows:

- Instant formatting and auto-fix on save via editor integration.  
- Problems panel & quick-fix light-bulbs in VS Code.  
- CLI commands: `ultracite check` (check only) and `ultracite fix` (check + write).  
- Example pre-commit script calling the CLI.

## Configuration  
Explains how to tweak defaults:

- Lists major defaults (strict TypeScript, React + a11y, Node/Next.js env, 2-space indent, 80-char width, etc.).  
- Shows how to disable or change rule severity in `biome.jsonc`.  
- Demonstrates per-line suppression with `// biome-ignore` comments.

## Examples  
Before/after code snippets illustrate:

- Automatic code formatting  
- Strict equality enforcement  
- Organising/removing imports  
- React button accessibility fix

Each example includes what Ultracite changes and why it improves reliability.

## FAQ  
Answers common questions such as:

- “Do I still need ESLint or Prettier?” (No)  
- “What files does it handle?” (JS/TS/JSX/CSS/GraphQL)  
- Update cadence, how to view all enabled rules, and how to disable a rule or opt out for a project.  
- Editor-agnostic usage without VS Code.

## Troubleshooting  
Solutions for typical problems:

- Biome not running on save  
- Conflicts with ESLint/Prettier  
- Ignoring third-party code with `ignore` patterns  
- Duplicate diagnostics, pre-commit or CI failures, and strict-null-checks errors  
- Notes on current Biome limitations (e.g., CSS lint coverage)

## Husky Integration  
Shows how `ultracite init` can wire up a Husky pre-commit hook that runs `npx ultracite fix` on staged files, ensuring consistent style before every commit.  Details automatic installation, how existing hooks are preserved, and troubleshooting tips (file permissions, skipping hooks).

## lint-staged Integration  
Describes optional lint-staged setup:

- Creates a config that runs `npx ultracite fix` only on staged files for fast commits.  
- Supports all config file types (`package.json`, `.lintstagedrc.*`, YAML, JS, MJS).  
- Explains smart merging with existing configs and how to customise patterns.

## Editor Rules  
Explains Ultracite’s AI-assistant rule files that guide code-generation tools:

- Automatic prompt during `ultracite init` to add rules for GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, or Zed.  
- Manual file locations and benefits (consistent, secure, accessible AI-generated code).  
- How to customise or extend rule files.

## MCP Integration  
Shows how to expose Ultracite docs to AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol:

- JSON config snippet pointing to the Ultracite MCP server.  
- Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.  
- Security notes (only public docs served, no user code sent).

## Goals  
Outlines guiding principles:

- Lightning-fast performance (inherit Rust speed from Biome)  
- Zero-config by default, but extensible  
- Intuitive, type-safe, and compatible with other tools

## Contributing  
Guides potential contributors:

- Source resides on GitHub (`haydenbleasel/ultracite`).  
- Local setup with `pnpm install`, linking a dev build to a sample project, running tests/fixtures.  
- Editing docs (Fumadocs app in `/docs`).  
- Release automation via Intuit Auto and semantic PR labels.  
- Community channels: GitHub issues & discussions.
