description: How to use Ultracite within a monorepo.

Ultracite is designed to work out of the box with monorepos. Here's how to use it with Turborepo.

## Configuration

When initializing Ultracite, it will create a `biome.jsonc` file in the root of your repository. This file will be used to configure Ultracite for your entire monorepo.

```
my-turborepo/
├── apps
├── packages
├── turbo.json
└── biome.jsonc
```

## Adding scripts

Because Biome is so fast, you can use a root script rather than creating separate scripts in each of your packages.

You can add the `check` and `fix` scripts to your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "check": "npx ultracite@latest check",
    "fix": "npx ultracite@latest fix"
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can also add the `check` and `fix` scripts to your `turbo.json` file.

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "//#check": {},
    "//#fix": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

You'll now be able to run these scripts using `turbo run check` and `turbo run fix`.
