description: How to integrate Ultracite with AI agents and editor hooks.
---

Ultracite can automatically format and fix code after AI agents make edits through editor hooks. This ensures all AI-generated code adheres to your project's standards without manual intervention.

## Cursor Integration

When you select **Cursor** in the hooks option during the initialization process, Ultracite automatically configures a hook to run after every file edit made by the Cursor agent.

> **Note:** Hooks are separate from agent rules. The `--agents` flag configures AI coding rules, while the `--hooks` flag sets up automatic formatting after file edits.

### What Gets Configured

Ultracite creates or updates `.cursor/hooks.json` in your project root with the following configuration:

```json title=".cursor/hooks.json"
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "afterFileEdit": [{ "command": "npx ultracite fix" }]
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Execution**: After Cursor's agent edits a file, the hook automatically runs `npx ultracite fix`
2. **Code Formatting**: Ultracite formats the edited code according to your Biome configuration
3. **Linting Fixes**: Auto-fixable linting issues are resolved automatically
4. **Seamless Integration**: The process happens transparently without interrupting your workflow

### Existing Hooks

If you already have hooks configured in `.cursor/hooks.json`, Ultracite intelligently merges the configuration:

- Preserves all existing hooks and their commands
- Appends the Ultracite command to the `afterFileEdit` array
- Avoids duplicate entries if Ultracite is already configured

Example with existing hooks:

```json title=".cursor/hooks.json"
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "afterFileEdit": [
      { "command": "npm run test:affected" },
      { "command": "npx ultracite fix" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Manual Configuration

If you skipped the hooks integration during initialization, you can add it later by running:

```bash
npx ultracite init --hooks cursor
```

Alternatively, you can manually create or edit `.cursor/hooks.json` in your project root:

1. Create or edit `.cursor/hooks.json` in your project root
2. Add the `afterFileEdit` hook with the Ultracite command
3. Run `npx ultracite fix` to verify the setup
