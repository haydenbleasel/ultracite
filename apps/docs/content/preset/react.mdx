---

The React configuration has React-specific linting rules for JSX, hooks, and component patterns.

## Installation

Add the React configuration to your `biome.jsonc`:

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "extends": ["ultracite/core", "ultracite/react"]
}
```

## Overview

This configuration adds rules specific to React development:

- **JSX Rules**: Enforce proper JSX syntax and patterns
- **Hooks Rules**: Ensure React hooks are used correctly
- **Component Rules**: Enforce React component best practices
- **Children Handling**: Prevent improper children prop usage

## React-Specific Rules

### Correctness

| Rule | Setting | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `noChildrenProp` | `error` | Prevent passing children as props. Children should be nested between the opening and closing tags. |
| `noNestedComponentDefinitions` | `error` | Prevent component definitions inside other components. This causes unnecessary re-renders. |
| `noReactPropAssignments` | `error` | Prevent reassigning props in React components. Props should be treated as immutable. |
| `noRenderReturnValue` | `error` | Prevent usage of the return value from `ReactDOM.render()`. |
| `noVoidElementsWithChildren` | `error` | Prevent void elements (like `<img>`, `<br>`) from having children. |
| `useExhaustiveDependencies` | `error` | Enforce all dependencies are correctly specified in React hooks (useEffect, useCallback, useMemo). |
| `useHookAtTopLevel` | `error` | Enforce that all React hooks are called from the top level of component functions, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. |
| `useJsxKeyInIterable` | `error` | Enforce that elements in iterables have a `key` prop for React's reconciliation. |

### Style

| Rule | Setting | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `useReactFunctionComponents` | `error` | Enforce using function components over class components in React. |

### Suspicious

| Rule | Setting | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `noArrayIndexKey` | `error` | Prevent using array indices as keys. Array indices are not stable identifiers and can cause issues with component state. |
| `noDuplicateJsxProps` | `error` | Prevent duplicate properties in JSX. |
| `noSuspiciousSemicolonInJsx` | `error` | Prevent semicolons that change the semantic of JSX elements. |
| `noReactSpecificProps` | `off` | Allow React-specific props like `className` and `htmlFor`. |
