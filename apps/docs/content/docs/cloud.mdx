Ultracite is free and open source — and always will be. The CLI, presets, and all configurations are available at no cost for individuals and teams of any size.

**Ultracite Cloud** is our paid offering for teams who want to automate and scale their code quality management. It automatically lints your GitHub repositories and fixes issues using AI. Connect your repos once, and Ultracite will keep your code clean without any manual intervention.

## Features

### Automated PR Reviews

When you open or update a pull request, Ultracite automatically:

1. Checks out your PR branch in a secure sandbox
2. Runs `ultracite fix` to auto-fix what it can
3. Uses Claude Code to fix remaining issues that require more context
4. Commits the fixes directly to your PR branch
5. Leaves a comment summarizing what was fixed

### Scheduled Lint Runs

Ultracite runs daily on your default branch to catch issues that slip through:

1. Clones your repository into a secure sandbox
2. Runs `ultracite fix` to auto-fix issues
3. If issues remain, uses Claude Code to fix one issue at a time
4. Creates a pull request with the fixes and a generated changelog

### Dashboard

The dashboard gives you visibility into:

- All connected repositories
- Lint run history and status
- Issues found and fixed
- Pull requests created

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Sign Up

Visit [ultracite.ai](https://ultracite.ai) and sign in with your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Install the GitHub App

Click "Connect GitHub" to install the Ultracite GitHub App on your organization or personal account. Select which repositories you want Ultracite to monitor.

### Step 3: Enable Repositories

In the dashboard, enable the repositories you want Ultracite to lint. Once enabled:

- New PRs will be automatically reviewed
- Daily lint runs will check your default branch

## How It Works

### Secure Sandboxes

All linting and fixes run in isolated sandbox environments. Your code is cloned, processed, and the sandbox is destroyed — we never store your source code.

### AI-Powered Fixes

When `ultracite fix` can't auto-fix an issue, Ultracite uses Claude Code to understand the context and apply intelligent fixes. This handles complex issues like:

- Refactoring to reduce cognitive complexity
- Adding missing accessibility attributes
- Fixing type errors that require code changes

### Pull Request Integration

Ultracite creates focused pull requests with:

- Clear commit messages explaining each fix
- Auto-generated changelogs describing what changed
- Links back to the Ultracite dashboard

## Permissions

The Ultracite GitHub App requires:

- **Read access** to code and metadata
- **Write access** to code and pull requests
- **Webhook events** for pull request and installation events

Ultracite only accesses repositories you explicitly enable.
