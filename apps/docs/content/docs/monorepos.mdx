description: How to use Ultracite within a monorepo.

Ultracite is designed to work out of the box with monorepos. Here's how to use it with Turborepo.

## Configuration

When initializing Ultracite, it will create the appropriate config file(s) in the root of your repository based on your chosen linter. This configuration applies to your entire monorepo.

```
my-turborepo/
├── apps/
├── packages/
├── turbo.json
└── biome.jsonc (or eslint.config.mjs, .oxlintrc.json, etc.)
```

## Adding scripts

Because Ultracite's underlying tools are fast (especially the Rust-based Biome and Oxlint), you can run a single root script rather than creating separate scripts in each package.

Add the `check` and `fix` scripts to your root `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "check": "ultracite check",
    "fix": "ultracite fix"
  }
}
```

Optionally, add these as root tasks in your `turbo.json`:

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "//#check": {},
    "//#fix": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

You can now run `turbo run check` and `turbo run fix` from anywhere in your monorepo.
