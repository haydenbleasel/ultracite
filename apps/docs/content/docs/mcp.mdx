description: How to use Ultracite with MCP
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other AI-powered tools to securely connect with external data sources and systems.

Ultracite provides an MCP server that gives AI assistants access to high-level coding standards and best practices — the same rules that guide AI code generation through Ultracite's editor integrations.

## What It Provides

The Ultracite MCP server exposes a single tool:

- **`getRules`** — Returns Ultracite's core coding standards covering type safety, modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns, React/JSX best practices, error handling, security, performance, and testing guidelines.

These are high-level coding principles, not the specific linting rules from each provider (Biome, ESLint, Oxlint). For provider-specific rule details, see the [Providers](/provider/biome) documentation.

## Installation

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Tool

Make sure you're using an AI development tool that supports MCP:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Windsurf by Codeium](https://windsurf.com/)
- Other MCP-compatible tools

### Step 2: Locate Your Configuration File

Depending on your AI tool, edit one of these files:

- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf**: `.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`

### Step 3: Add Ultracite Configuration

Add this to your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ultracite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://www.ultracite.ai/api/mcp/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Restart Your AI Tool

Close and reopen your AI application for the changes to take effect.

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant about Ultracite's coding standards:

> What are Ultracite's coding standards?

The AI will retrieve the high-level principles covering:

- Type safety and explicitness
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
- React and JSX best practices
- Async and Promise handling
- Error handling and debugging
- Code organization
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Testing guidelines

## Multiple MCP Servers

You can use Ultracite alongside other MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ultracite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://www.ultracite.ai/api/mcp/mcp"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security and Privacy

- The Ultracite MCP server only provides public coding standards documentation
- No personal data or code is transmitted to our servers
- No authentication required
