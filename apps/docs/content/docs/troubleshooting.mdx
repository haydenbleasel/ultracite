Even though Ultracite aims to simplify linting and formatting, you might encounter some issues during setup and usage. Here are some common issues and their solutions:

## "Ultracite isn't formatting on save in VS Code."

Double-check that you have the appropriate VS Code extension installed and enabled for your chosen linter (Biome, ESLint, or Oxlint). Verify your `.vscode/settings.json` contains the correct `editor.defaultFormatter` and `editor.codeActionsOnSave` entries generated by Ultracite.

Also ensure there's no conflicting formatter or linter extension enabled. If you have multiple formatting extensions active, they might interfere or take precedence over each other.

You may need to disable VS Code's built-in Format On Save if another formatter is grabbing the file. Try running the "Format Document" command manually and see if the correct formatter is used or if any error appears.

## "I installed Ultracite, but VS Code still uses my old linter."

Ensure you removed or turned off your old configs. For example, if you have leftover `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, or `biome.jsonc` files from a previous setup, VS Code extensions might still pick them up and cause duplicate diagnostics.

It's recommended to remove those configs (or at least disable the corresponding extensions) when switching linters to avoid confusion. Let your chosen Ultracite toolchain take over as the sole linter/formatter.

## "Ultracite is throwing parse errors for files I don't want it to check."

A common example is installing components from a UI library like [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/). While they're designed to be modified, you may want to preserve the original source code for updates. In this case, you'll want to exclude those files from linting.

For Biome, add patterns to your `biome.jsonc`:

```json title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["!components/ui/**", "!lib/**", "!hooks/**"]
  }
}
```

By default, all linters should ignore `node_modules`, but if you opened a file manually from there, the extension might still try to lint it. Generally, ignore generated files or third-party code.

Another cause could be experimental syntax that your linter can't parse yet. Check your linter's issue tracker for support of that syntax.

## "I see double errors for the same issue."

This can happen if you have multiple linters running at once. It can also occur if VS Code's TypeScript checker and your linter both report the same error.

To resolve, standardize on one tool per type of check. If using Ultracite, disable other linters. For TypeScript type errors, VS Code's built-in TS server will show them (red squiggles for type issues) — your linter may also show type-driven lint issues. Usually this is fine as they highlight the same problem.

If it bothers you, you can turn off VS Code's TS validator (`"typescript.validate.enable": false` in settings), or vice versa. Just ensure you don't have two linters with overlapping functionality enabled.

## "Pre-commit hook/CI is failing due to Ultracite."

If your pre-commit hook runs `ultracite check` and fails, it means there are issues that weren't auto-fixed (or someone bypassed running it). Run `ultracite fix` locally to auto-fix what can be fixed, then inspect the remaining output.

Address any remaining issues manually, then commit. If CI is failing on `ultracite check`, do the same: run it locally to see what issues were found. Treat Ultracite failures like failing tests — something to correct in code.

## "I get an error about `strictNullChecks` or type issues after enabling Ultracite."

Ultracite expects TypeScript strictness. If you haven't enabled `strictNullChecks` (or full `strict` mode), you might get TypeScript-related lint warnings about potential undefined usage that TS isn't catching due to loose settings.

The solution is to enable strict flags in your `tsconfig.json` as recommended. If you cannot do this for legacy reasons, you may need to disable certain rules that assume strictness. However, it's highly recommended to use TS strict mode — it improves code quality and aligns with Ultracite's philosophy.

## "Ultracite is too strict for our team — can I tone it down?"

Yes. While Ultracite's value is in being strict, you're free to override rules. If developers are overwhelmed by warnings, identify which rules are causing friction and turn them to `warn` or `off` in your config.

For instance, if you find the accessibility rules too noisy for an internal tool, you might disable some of them. Or if you disagree with a code style enforced, you can adjust it.

The key is communication with the team — perhaps educate why a rule exists before disabling it. If still unwanted, customize the config. Check out the [Configuration](/configuration) section for more information on how to override rules.

## "Are there known limitations I should be aware of?"

Each linter has different coverage:

- **Biome** handles JS/TS/JSX/TSX/JSON/CSS/GraphQL but doesn't have every rule from ESLint's plugin ecosystem.
- **ESLint + Prettier + Stylelint** has the most comprehensive rule coverage with 20+ plugins, but is slower.
- **Oxlint** is the fastest but focuses on bug-catching rules over stylistic ones.

If your project relies on specific rules from a particular ecosystem (like certain Stylelint CSS checks or ESLint plugins), make sure your chosen linter supports them or consider using that toolchain instead.
