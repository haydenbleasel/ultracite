description: Ultracite's default linting configuration and how to modify it.
---

One of Ultracite's best features is that it's zero-config out of the box — you can just extend the base preset and get going. However, every project is different, and you might want to customize certain rules or adapt Ultracite for different frameworks.

## Framework Presets

Ultracite provides framework-specific configurations that you can extend in addition to the base `core` configuration. This allows you to add framework-specific linting rules without bloating the base config or dealing with irrelevant rules.

The pattern is the same across all supported linters — import the `core` preset, then add any framework presets you need:

```
ultracite/{linter}/core
ultracite/{linter}/{framework}
```

For example, if you're using Biome with React and Next.js, you can pull in the following presets:

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "extends": [
    "ultracite/biome/core",
    "ultracite/biome/react",
    "ultracite/biome/next",
  ],
}
```

## Default Configuration

When you include the `core` preset, you're pulling in Ultracite's base configuration. This preset includes framework-agnostic rules and settings. Some notable aspects:

- **TypeScript strictness**: Enables strict checks and lint rules requiring robust typing. Discourages use of `any`, requires handling of `null/undefined`, and prefers explicit types where needed.
- **Best practices**: Common rules like no unused vars, no explicit eval, no prototype pollution, etc.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and other a11y rules are enabled by default.
- **Formatting conventions**: 2-space indentation, 80-character line width, semicolons, trailing commas, and single quotes (varies slightly by linter).

All these defaults aim to enforce consistent style and prevent common errors without manual configuration.

## Overriding Rules

Each linter has its own way to disable or modify rules. For example, to disable the `noAutofocus` rule for Biome, you can do the following:

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "extends": ["ultracite/biome/core"],
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "a11y": {
        "noAutofocus": "off",
      },
    },
  },
}
```
