description: Automatically run Ultracite on your staged Git files before committing.
---

Ultracite integrates with popular Git hook tools to automatically format and lint your code before every commit. This ensures all committed code follows your project's standards without manual intervention.

## Setup

During initialization, you can select which Git hook tool to use:

```bash
npx ultracite init --integrations husky,lint-staged
```

Or select them interactively when prompted.

## Supported Tools

### Husky

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is a popular tool for managing Git hooks. Ultracite creates a `.husky/pre-commit` file that runs `npx ultracite fix` before each commit.

```bash title=".husky/pre-commit"
npx ultracite fix
```

### lefthook

[lefthook](https://lefthook.dev/) is a fast Git hooks manager written in Go. Ultracite creates a `lefthook.yml` configuration:

```yaml title="lefthook.yml"
pre-commit:
  jobs:
    - run: npx ultracite fix
      stage_fixed: true
```

### lint-staged

[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) runs linters only on staged files. Ultracite adds configuration to your `package.json` or creates a `.lintstagedrc` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,jsonc,css}": ["npx ultracite fix"]
  }
}
```

Note: lint-staged is typically used alongside Husky or lefthook to trigger the pre-commit hook.

### pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a Python-based framework for managing Git hooks. Ultracite creates a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml title=".pre-commit-config.yaml"
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ultracite
        name: ultracite
        entry: npx ultracite fix
        language: system
        types_or: [javascript, jsx, ts, tsx, json, css]
        pass_filenames: false
```

After setup, run `pre-commit install` to activate the hooks.

## How It Works

1. You make changes and stage files with `git add`
2. You run `git commit`
3. The pre-commit hook runs `npx ultracite fix`
4. Code is formatted and auto-fixable issues are resolved
5. The commit proceeds with properly formatted code

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All committed code follows the same standards
- **Automation**: No need to remember to format code manually
- **Clean History**: Formatting issues never enter your repository
- **Team Collaboration**: Everyone follows the same rules automatically

## Bypassing Hooks

In rare cases where you need to skip the pre-commit hook:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

Use this sparingly, as it bypasses the automated formatting.
