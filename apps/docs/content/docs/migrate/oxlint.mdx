title: Migrate from Oxlint
description: How to migrate your project from standalone Oxlint to Ultracite.
---

If you're already using Oxlint and want to switch to Ultracite's preconfigured setup, this guide will help you migrate while preserving your code quality standards.

## Why Migrate to Ultracite?

- **Zero Configuration**: Ultracite provides a highly configured preset of rules
- **Editor Integration**: Built-in support for AI-powered editors (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- **Consistent Workflow**: Standardized setup across projects and teams
- **Additional Tooling**: Optional Git hooks, lint-staged integration
- **Maintained Rules**: Regular updates with new best practices

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- An existing project using Oxlint
- Node.js v14.18+ (Node 18+ recommended)
- An Oxlint configuration file (e.g., `.oxlintrc.json`)

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Quick Migration (Recommended)

The fastest way is to run the [automatic setup script](/setup#automatic-installation).

```package-install
npx ultracite init
```

When prompted, select **Oxlint** as your linting provider. This will:

- Install Ultracite as a dependency
- Merge your existing `.oxlintrc.json` with Ultracite's preset
- Create an `.oxfmtrc.jsonc` for formatting configuration
- Merge your existing `.vscode/settings.json` with Ultracite's preset
- Enable `strictNullChecks` in your `tsconfig.json` file (or create one if it doesn't exist)
- Preserve your custom rules and settings
- Set up editor integrations

Following the upgrade, you may want to review your `.oxlintrc.json` file to remove any overrides that are now handled by Ultracite's preset.

### Option 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer more control over the process, update your `.oxlintrc.json` to extend Ultracite:

```jsonc title=".oxlintrc.json"
{
  "extends": ["ultracite/oxlint/core"]
}
```

After the migration, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.
