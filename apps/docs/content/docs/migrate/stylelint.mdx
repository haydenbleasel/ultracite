title: Migrate from Stylelint
description: How to migrate your project from Stylelint to Ultracite.
---

If you're already using Stylelint and want to switch to Ultracite's preconfigured setup, this guide will help you migrate while preserving your styling standards.

## Why Migrate to Ultracite?

- **Lightning Speed**: Biome (Ultracite's foundation) is based on Rust, much faster than Stylelint
- **Zero Configuration**: Ultracite provides a highly configured preset of rules
- **Editor Integration**: Built-in support for AI-powered editors (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- **Consistent Workflow**: Standardized setup across projects and teams
- **Maintained Rules**: Regular updates with new best practices

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- An existing project using Stylelint
- Node.js v14.18+ (Node 18+ recommended)
- A Stylelint configuration file (e.g., `.stylelintrc`, `stylelint.config.js`)

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Quick Migration (Recommended)

The fastest way is to run the [automatic setup script](/setup#automatic-installation).

```package-install
npx ultracite init
```

This will:

- Install Ultracite as a dependency
- Merge your existing `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` with Ultracite's preset
- Merge your existing `.vscode/settings.json` with Ultracite's preset
- Enable `strictNullChecks` in your `tsconfig.json` file (or create one if it doesn't exist)
- Preserve your custom rules and settings
- Set up editor integrations

When prompted, choose to remove the existing Stylelint configuration. This will:

- Remove Stylelint and any related dependencies
- Remove any Stylelint configuration files
- Remove any Stylelint related commands from your `.vscode/settings.json` file

Following the upgrade, you may want to review your `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` file to remove any overrides. Additionally, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.

### Option 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer more control over the process, follow the [Manual Migration](/setup#manual-installation) steps by:

- Installing Ultracite and Biome manually
- Updating your `biome.json` file to extend Ultracite
- Creating or updating a `.vscode/settings.json` file to enable the Biome extension
- Enabling `strictNullChecks` in your `tsconfig.json` file (or create one if it doesn't exist)
- Manually removing Stylelint and its configuration files

After the migration, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.
