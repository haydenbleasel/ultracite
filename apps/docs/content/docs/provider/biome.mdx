description: The modern, all-in-one toolchain for JavaScript and TypeScript.
---

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) is a fast, all-in-one toolchain for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Written in Rust, it combines formatting and linting into a single binary with zero dependencies.

## Benefits

- **Lightning fast** — Formats large codebases in milliseconds
- **All-in-one toolchain** — No more juggling ESLint, Prettier, and other tools
- **Zero dependencies** — One binary does everything with consistent behavior
- **Multi-language support** — Handles JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, JSON, CSS, GraphQL, and HTML
- **Smart sorting** — Automatically organizes imports, JSX attributes, and Tailwind CSS classes

## Usage

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "extends": ["ultracite/biome/core"],
}
```

Add framework presets as needed:

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "extends": [
    "ultracite/biome/core",
    "ultracite/biome/react",
    "ultracite/biome/next",
  ],
}
```

## Configuration Approach

Ultracite's Biome configuration uses an **opt-in** approach. This means every rule is explicitly specified in the configuration — nothing is implicitly inherited. This gives you full visibility into exactly which rules are enabled and at what level.

## Rule Categories

Biome organizes rules into the following categories:

### Accessibility (a11y)

Rules that enforce ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility best practices. Examples include requiring alt text for images, valid ARIA roles, and proper heading structure.

### Complexity

Rules that reduce cognitive complexity and enforce best practices. Examples include preferring `for...of` over `forEach`, using optional chaining, and avoiding excessive nesting.

### Correctness

Rules that prevent common errors and enforce type safety. Examples include catching unused variables, invalid regex patterns, unreachable code, and incorrect use of hooks.

### Performance

Rules that optimize code for better runtime performance. Examples include avoiding accumulating spread in loops, discouraging barrel files, and enforcing efficient patterns.

### Security

Rules that prevent security vulnerabilities. Examples include blocking `eval()`, requiring `rel="noopener"` on external links, and flagging dangerous `innerHTML` usage.

### Style

Rules that enforce consistent code style. Examples include preferring `const` over `let`, using template literals, enforcing consistent type definitions, and file naming conventions.

### Suspicious

Rules that catch suspicious patterns that might indicate bugs. Examples include flagging `debugger` statements, duplicate object keys, and implicit type coercion.

## Formatter Settings

Ultracite configures Biome's formatter with these defaults:

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Line Width**: 80 characters
- **Line Ending**: LF (Unix-style)
- **Semicolons**: Always required
- **Trailing Commas**: ES5 style
- **Arrow Parentheses**: Always include
