description: The fastest linter available, 50-100x faster than ESLint.
---

[Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) is part of the [Oxc project](https://oxc.rs/), a collection of high-performance JavaScript tools written in Rust. Paired with [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/) for formatting, this toolchain is ideal for large codebases where speed is critical.

## Benefits

- **50-100x faster** — Lint your entire codebase in milliseconds
- **15 plugin equivalents** — Built-in support for React, TypeScript, Next.js, Vue, Jest, Vitest, and more
- **Bug-focused rules** — Prioritizes catching real bugs over stylistic issues
- **High signal-to-noise ratio** — Fewer false positives, more actionable feedback
- **Oxc ecosystem** — Part of a larger project with parser, resolver, transformer, and minifier
- **Drop-in ready** — Works alongside existing setups or as a complete replacement

## Usage

Ultracite generates two config files for Oxlint:

```jsonc title=".oxlintrc.json"
{
  "extends": ["./node_modules/ultracite/config/oxlint/core/.oxlintrc.json"]
}
```

```jsonc title=".oxfmtrc.jsonc"
{
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "printWidth": 80
}
```

Add framework presets as needed:

```jsonc title=".oxlintrc.json"
{
  "extends": [
    "./node_modules/ultracite/config/oxlint/core/.oxlintrc.json",
    "./node_modules/ultracite/config/oxlint/react/.oxlintrc.json",
    "./node_modules/ultracite/config/oxlint/next/.oxlintrc.json"
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Approach

Ultracite's Oxlint configuration uses an **opt-out** approach. This means we enable all rule categories at the `error` level, then selectively disable rules that are too strict or don't fit our opinionated defaults. This ensures maximum bug-catching coverage while avoiding noise.

## Rule Categories

Oxlint organizes rules into the following categories:

### Correctness

Rules that catch definite bugs and errors. These are high-confidence rules that identify code that is almost certainly wrong.

### Suspicious

Rules that catch code patterns that are likely bugs or mistakes. These have a slightly higher false-positive rate but catch important issues.

### Pedantic

Rules that enforce stricter coding standards. These are more opinionated and may require more effort to satisfy.

### Performance

Rules that identify performance issues and suggest optimizations for better runtime efficiency.

### Restriction

Rules that restrict certain language features or patterns. These are typically project-specific preferences.

### Style

Rules that enforce consistent code style across the codebase.

## Included Plugins

Oxlint includes built-in support equivalent to these ESLint plugins:

- **eslint** — Core JavaScript rules
- **typescript** — TypeScript-specific rules
- **unicorn** — Opinionated code quality rules
- **oxc** — Oxc-specific optimizations
- **import** — Import/export validation
- **jsdoc** — JSDoc comment validation
- **node** — Node.js-specific rules
- **promise** — Promise and async/await best practices
- **jest** / **vitest** — Testing framework rules

## Formatter Settings (Oxfmt)

Ultracite configures Oxfmt with these defaults:

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Line Width**: 80 characters
- **Semicolons**: Always required
- **Single Quotes**: Yes
- **Trailing Commas**: ES5 style
- **Arrow Parentheses**: Always include
