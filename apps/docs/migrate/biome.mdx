title: Migrate from Biome
description: How to migrate your project from standalone Biome to Ultracite.
---

If you're already using Biome and want to switch to Ultracite's preconfigured setup, this guide will help you migrate while preserving your existing configuration.

## Why Migrate to Ultracite?

- **Zero Configuration**: Ultracite provides a highly configured preset of rules
- **Editor Integration**: Built-in support for AI-powered editors (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- **Consistent Workflow**: Standardized setup across projects and teams
- **Additional Tooling**: Optional Git hooks, lint-staged integration
- **Maintained Rules**: Regular updates with new best practices

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- An existing project using Biome
- Node.js v14.18+ (Node 18+ recommended)
- A `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc` file

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Quick Migration (Recommended)

The fastest way is to run the [automatic setup script](/setup#automatic-installation).

```package-install
npx ultracite init
```

When prompted, select **Biome** as your linting provider. This will:

- Install Ultracite as a dependency
- Merge your existing `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` with Ultracite's preset
- Merge your existing `.vscode/settings.json` with Ultracite's preset
- Enable `strictNullChecks` in your `tsconfig.json` file (or create one if it doesn't exist)
- Preserve your custom rules and settings
- Set up editor integrations

Following the upgrade, you may want to review your `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` file to remove any overrides that are now handled by Ultracite's preset.

### Option 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer more control over the process, update your `biome.jsonc` to extend Ultracite:

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "extends": ["ultracite/biome/core"]
}
```

After the migration, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.
