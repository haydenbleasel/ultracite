---

Ultracite is a fast, intuitive, and simple development tool that brings automated code formatting and linting to your JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Built on top of [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (a high-performance Rust-based code formatter/linter), Ultracite provides a robust, preconfigured setup optimized for Next.js (React) by default.

It is highly opinionated and strict, enforcing strong type safety and code quality guidelines out-of-the-box. Once set up, Ultracite runs mostly in the background – automatically formatting your code and applying fixes every time you save your files – so you can focus on writing code instead of manually correcting style issues or runtime errors.

## Core Benefits

- Fast: Leverages Biome’s Rust engine for lightning-fast formatting and linting. It can process code in a fraction of a second, making on-save checks feel instant.
- Intuitive: Works seamlessly with your editor to run fixes on save. No extra steps needed – just hit save and Ultracite handles the rest.
- Simple: Zero-config by design. It comes with preconfigured rules (optimized for Next.js/React projects) so you don’t need to bikeshed over lint rules. It “just works” with sensible defaults, while still allowing customization when needed.
