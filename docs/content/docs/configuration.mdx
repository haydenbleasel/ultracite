While Ultracite is designed to be zero-config, you can extend the configuration to your liking.

## Modifying `biome.json`

You can disable rules by modifying the `biome.json` file.

For example, to disable the `noAutofocus` rule, you can do the following:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.9.4/schema.json",
  "extends": ["ultracite"],
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "a11y": {
        "noAutofocus": "off"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or, if you use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and don't want to modify the core files, you can ignore them:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["ultracite"],
  "ignore": ["/components/ui/**", "/lib/**", "/hooks/**"]
}
```

## Inline Comments

You can also disable rules on a per-line basis by adding a comment to the end of the line:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
// biome-ignore lint/security/noDangerouslySetInnerHtml: I do what I want mate.
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ ... }} />
```
