description: What is Ultracite?
---

Ultracite is a robust linting configuration for modern TypeScript apps, built on [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/). It is incredibly opinionated and strict, enforcing the maximum amount of type safety and code quality. Once Ultracite is set up, it will automatically lint, fix and format your code on save.
