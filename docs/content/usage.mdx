With installation and setup complete, you’re ready to use Ultracite.

## Automatic usage

Ultracite is most powerful when integrated into your editor, so you get immediate feedback as you write code.

It is designed to run automatically on save. To test it out, open a project in VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf / etc. As you edit files, you should see formatting take effect on save. Try introducing a small code style mistake (like an extra semicolon or a wrongly indented line) and hit Save – Ultracite (Biome) will instantly reformat the file.

If you introduce a common lint issue (like an unused variable), you might see a squiggly underline or a warning in the Problems panel; on save, Ultracite will attempt to fix it if it’s auto-fixable (for example, remove an unused import) or otherwise leave a warning for you to address.

- Format on Save: Every time you save a file, Biome (with Ultracite’s config) formats the file. You don’t need to run a separate Prettier or worry about formatting – it’s taken care of.
- Fix on Save: Thanks to the codeActionsOnSave settings, VS Code will also apply Biome’s “fix all” action on save. This means any lint rule that has an auto-fix (like converting != to !==, adding missing parentheses, fixing import order, etc.) will be applied. It’s as if you ran --fix with ESLint automatically.
- Problems panel integration: Any issues that remain (which require your attention) will show up in the Problems panel. For example, if Ultracite has a rule that prohibits something or finds an error it can’t fix (say, you used a deprecated API or forgot to handle a Promise rejection), it will list it as an error or warning. You can click it to jump to the location in code.
- Code lenses / Quick fixes: In many cases, the VS Code extension for Biome provides quick fix suggestions. If you see a yellow lightbulb or a suggestion popup, you can apply fixes manually as well. For instance, if a import is unused, you might get a quick fix to remove it (if it wasn’t already removed on save).
- On paste: We even enabled formatOnPaste – so if you paste code from elsewhere, it will immediately be formatted to match your style.
The key advantage here is instant feedback. You write code in VS Code, and Ultracite continuously keeps it clean. Over time, you’ll notice you spend little to no time fixing lint errors – Ultracite either fixes them for you or points them out early. This leads to a smooth development workflow where code style and minor issues never pile up.
- Other Editors (Vim/NeoVim, JetBrains, etc.): While there isn’t an official Ultracite plugin for other editors yet, you can still integrate Biome:
- NeoVim: You can use the @biomejs/biome LSP server with a client like nvim-lspconfig. This would give you on-the-fly diagnostics and formatting similar to VS Code (using the same biome.json config).
- WebStorm/IntelliJ: These IDEs don’t have Biome support at the moment, but you could configure an External Tool to run npx ultracite on save or format. Alternatively, run Ultracite manually via a shortcut.
- Pre-commit hooks: As mentioned, even if your editor doesn’t auto-run Ultracite, a Git pre-commit hook that runs ultracite can serve as a safety net to auto-format code before it’s committed. This isn’t as instantaneous as an editor integration, but it ensures consistency.

In general, as Biome gains popularity, expect more first-class integrations. The VS Code extension is the reference implementation for now. If you’re not on VS Code, you still benefit from Ultracite’s speed and unified approach; you’ll just invoke it differently (manually or via other automation).

## Manual CLI usage

Ultracite comes with a convenient CLI (invoked as ultracite when installed). Here are common ways to use it.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx ultracite format
```

## Linting

The `lint` command wraps the Biome `check` command, which runs the linter without fixing files.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx ultracite lint
```

## Formatting

The `format` command wraps the Biome `check --write` command, which runs the linter and fixes files.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx ultracite format
```
