Ultracite will automatically lint, fix and format your code on save.

If you'd like to run Ultracite manually, you can do so with the following commands.

## Linting

The `lint` command wraps the Biome `check` command, which runs the linter without fixing files.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx ultracite lint
```

## Formatting

The `format` command wraps the Biome `check --write` command, which runs the linter and fixes files.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx ultracite format
```
