## Q: What exactly is Ultracite ‚Äì how is it different from Biome or ESLint?

Ultracite is essentially a preset configuration built on Biome. Think of Ultracite as a curated bundle of rules and settings, whereas Biome is the engine that actually formats/lints code. You can use Biome by itself, but you‚Äôd have to decide which rules to enable and configure its options manually. Ultracite saves you that effort by providing a ready-to-go setup, influenced by the best practices from ESLint, Prettier, etc. Compared to ESLint+Prettier, Ultracite (with Biome) is faster (thanks to Rust) and unified (one tool instead of two or three). In short: Biome = tool (linter/formatter), Ultracite = configuration + integration glue for developers (particularly Next.js/TS folks). If you already love tweaking every ESLint rule, Ultracite might feel restrictive; but it aims to eliminate the need for that and adopt sensible defaults.

## Q: Do I still need ESLint or Prettier if I use Ultracite?

No ‚Äì Ultracite (via Biome) replaces the functionality of ESLint and Prettier for your JS/TS code. You do not need to run ESLint or Prettier at all. In fact, it‚Äôs recommended to remove those configs to avoid conflicts. Ultracite‚Äôs output will cover formatting and linting that those tools did, usually with equivalent or stricter rules. The only case you might still use them is if you have some edge-case plugin not supported by Biome (for example, a very specialized ESLint rule). But ideally, you‚Äôd work with Ultracite‚Äôs ecosystem entirely.

## Q: Is Ultracite only for Next.js projects? Can I use it in a Node.js or React Native project?

You can absolutely use Ultracite in any JavaScript/TypeScript project. While its defaults were optimized for Next.js (a common denominator requiring strict checks), it works for Node.js (backend), React Native, plain React, or even non-React TS libraries. Many rules in Ultracite are generic (not framework-specific). For frameworks beyond React, see the Configuration section for notes on tweaking Ultracite (e.g., ignoring .vue files or disabling React-only rules). But many users have successfully used Ultracite in Node.js server projects and library projects to enforce code quality. It‚Äôs a general tool ‚Äì the Next.js mention is more about its initial target audience.

## Q: What about my CSS/Sass and other files? Does Ultracite handle those?

Biome (the engine) can format CSS, and thus Ultracite will format your CSS files (and inline CSS in JS, like styled-jsx or CSS-in-JS objects). It doesn‚Äôt have the full linting rules that Stylelint has; for example, it won‚Äôt complain about using !important or unsupported browser properties, etc. If you need heavy CSS linting, you might add Stylelint for those specific rules. For most projects, consistent formatting of CSS (indentation, etc.) is often enough, which Biome provides. Ultracite doesn‚Äôt handle Sass/SCSS or Less specifically (Biome currently formats CSS, not SCSS). If you use SCSS, you may rely on the IDE or Prettier for SCSS, or compile to CSS then format. In summary: Ultracite focuses on JS/TS, with some support for CSS/JSON. Other file types (Markdown, SCSS, etc.) are outside its scope right now.

## Q: The name ‚ÄúUltracite‚Äù ‚Äì any relation to Fallout (the game)?

üôÇ Ultracite is indeed a term from the Fallout game series (a powerful material). The choice of name here is likely just a fun nod, suggesting this tool is a ‚Äúpowerful resource‚Äù for developers. It doesn‚Äôt have any functional relation to the game, of course. It‚Äôs just a catchy name for a robust preset. (So, no, you won‚Äôt be crafting power armor with this Ultracite!)

## Q: How often is Ultracite updated?

Ultracite is updated as needed, often following Biome‚Äôs release cycle. Since Biome is still evolving, you might see frequent minor releases to Ultracite (especially in the initial phases around 2024-2025). These updates can bring new rules, bug fixes, or adjustments to defaults. Given it‚Äôs pinned via --save-exact, you won‚Äôt get surprise updates unless you choose to upgrade. It‚Äôs a good idea to watch the Ultracite repo for releases or check the CHANGELOG. When updating Ultracite, read release notes ‚Äì occasionally a new rule might be enabled that could surface new warnings in your project (which is a good thing for catching issues, but should be aware of it). Upgrading Biome along with Ultracite is usually straightforward via package manager.

## Q: If I disagree with a rule Ultracite enforces, what should I do?

You have a few options:

- Configure it off or to a different level in your biome.json (quick fix for your project).
- Discuss on the Ultracite GitHub if the rule should be adjusted for everyone. Perhaps the maintainers might agree it‚Äôs too strict or could be optional.
- If it‚Äôs a stylistic thing, remember the goal of Ultracite is to have convention over configuration ‚Äì sometimes it‚Äôs worth adapting to the tool‚Äôs style for consistency across projects. But of course, your project‚Äôs needs come first.

Ultimately, you control your project‚Äôs lint config. Ultracite is a starting point; feel free to mold it, but ideally in minor ways. If you find yourself turning off a majority of rules, then Ultracite might not be the right preset for your team‚Äôs preferences (though that would be uncommon). In that case, you could build your own Biome config from scratch, but you‚Äôd lose a lot of the convenience. Usually, a few tweaks is all that‚Äôs needed to make Ultracite fit nicely.

## Q: Can I use Ultracite without VS Code?

Yes. While VS Code integration is a highlight (because it automates the fixes on save), Ultracite can be used purely via CLI or with other editor setups. You might run ultracite manually or on git hooks as described. Some users use Vim/Neovim with Biome‚Äôs LSP for on-the-fly linting. Others might just rely on CI to catch things and run formatting occasionally. Of course, you don‚Äôt get the same seamless experience as VS Code‚Äôs on-save, but the core functionality is fully available. The Biome project is exploring and improving editor integrations, so keep an eye out ‚Äì there may be official support for more editors over time.

## Q: How do I know what rules Ultracite is enforcing? Is there a list?

Since Ultracite‚Äôs config is essentially a wrapper around Biome‚Äôs rules, one way is to consult Biome‚Äôs documentation for the list of lint rules (they often have similar names to ESLint rules). The Ultracite GitHub might also have the config file where you can see which rules are turned on/off. Because it extends Biome‚Äôs recommended defaults too, you can assume many common rules (no unused vars, etc.) are on. If you want to see in practice, run npx ultracite --check on your project and see what issues it flags ‚Äì that gives insight into active rules. Also, when using VS Code, each diagnostic comes with a code (like lint/a11y/noAutofocus), which indicates the rule. You can search that code in Biome‚Äôs docs to get more info on what it expects. In the future, Ultracite‚Äôs documentation might include a comprehensive rules table if there‚Äôs demand.

## Q: Can Ultracite fix all issues it finds?

Not all, but many. Ultracite (Biome) will auto-fix issues that are safe and deterministic to fix. These include formatting issues and many lint errors (particularly stylistic or simple code transformations like removing unused imports, adding missing parentheses, changing == to ===, etc.). More complex issues (business logic or things that require developer intention) are left for you to fix. For example, it won‚Äôt magically rename variables to follow a naming convention or add missing error handling code ‚Äì it will just warn you. The philosophy is similar to ESLint‚Äôs: provide fixes where possible, but don‚Äôt risk altering code behavior. Always review the Problems panel or CLI output for any remaining warnings after auto-fix.

## Q: Where can I learn more about Biome (the tool Ultracite uses)?

Biome has its own website with documentation, and you can find more technical details there. If you‚Äôre curious about how it formats code or the philosophy behind certain choices, the Biome docs are the best resource. Additionally, there are blog posts and community articles about Biome‚Äôs rise as a successor to Rome. Understanding Biome can help you better understand Ultracite‚Äôs capabilities. However, you don‚Äôt need to learn Biome in-depth to use Ultracite effectively ‚Äì Ultracite‚Äôs goal is to abstract those details away for most users.

## Q: How do I disable Ultracite for a specific project or file?

If you have a project where you temporarily don‚Äôt want Ultracite, you can simply not include the extends: ["ultracite"] in biome.json (or remove the config file). If the VS Code extension is installed, it may still try to format on save using Biome‚Äôs defaults. To fully disable, you could turn off formatOnSave or uninstall the Biome extension for that workspace. For a specific file, as mentioned, use ignore comments or patterns. Essentially, Ultracite is opt-in per project via the config. If it‚Äôs not configured, it won‚Äôt run (Biome itself might still run formatting if triggered, but not linting rules).
