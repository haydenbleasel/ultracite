Ultracite v5 is a major release with significant improvements and breaking changes. This guide will help you upgrade your existing v4 setup to v5.

## What's New in v5

- **Updated Biome**: Upgraded from v1.x to v2.x
- **New Configuration Format**: Switch from `biome.json` to `biome.jsonc`
- **Enhanced CLI**: Rewritten in TypeScript with better error handling
- **Editor Integrations**: Built-in support for Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, and GitHub Copilot
- **Git Hooks**: Optional integrations including Husky, lint-staged and lefthook
- **Improved Schema**: New schema URL with better validation
- **Simplified VS Code Settings**: Combined filetype overrides into a single line

## Migration Steps

### Automatic Migration (Recommended)

The easiest way to migrate is to run the new initialization command:

```package-install
npx ultracite@latest init
```

This will:
- Update your dependencies to the latest versions
- Update your `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`  
- Update your VS Code settings
- Offer to set up AI editor rules (Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, etc.)
- Offer to set up new integrations (Git hooks, lint-staged, etc.)

After the upgrade, you may want to review your `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` file to remove any overrides. Additionally, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.

Additionally, please review the Biome [v2 upgrade guide](https://biomejs.dev/guides/upgrade-to-biome-v2/) for more information on schema / rule changes.

### Manual Migration

If you prefer more control over the process, follow the [Manual Migration](/setup#manual-installation) steps by:

- Installing the updated versions of Ultracite and Biome manually
- Updating your `biome.json` file to the new schema version
- Updating the `.vscode/settings.json` file (optional)
- Adding an AI editor rules file (optional)
- Adding new integrations (optional)

After the migration, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.
