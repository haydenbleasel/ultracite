Ultracite is a fast, intuitive and simple development tool that brings automated code formatting and linting to your JavaScript / TypeScript projects. Built on top of [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (a Rust-based code formatter and linter), Ultracite provides a robust, preconfigured setup optimized for modern web development.

Install Ultracite quickly by running:

```package-install
npx ultracite init
```

Then follow the [Usage](/usage) guide to get started.

You can pass the following flags to the `init` command:

| Flag                | Description                                      | Options                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--pm`              | The package manager to use.                      | `pnpm`, `bun`, `yarn`, `npm`                                            |
| `--editors`         | The editors to configure.                        | Comma-separated: `vscode`, `zed`, `none`                                |
| `--rules`           | The AI Editor rule files to create.              | Comma-separated: `vscode-copilot`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `zed`, `claude`, `codex`, `none` |
| `--features`        | Additional features to enable.                   | Comma-separated: `husky`, `lefthook`, `lint-staged`, `none`             |
| `--remove-prettier` | Remove Prettier dependencies and configuration.  | (no value needed)                                                       |
| `--remove-eslint`   | Remove ESLint dependencies and configuration.    | (no value needed)                                                       |
| `--skip-install`    | Skip installing dependencies.                    | (no value needed)                                                       |

## How does Ultracite work?

Once set up, Ultracite runs mostly in the background — automatically formatting your code and applying fixes every time you save your files. Because Biome is so fast, even on large projects, running Ultracite’s checks is extremely fast and can comfortably run on every save without lag. This means you can focus on building and shipping instead of manually correcting style issues or debugging runtime errors.

## What is Biome?

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) is an all-in-one toolchain for code formatting and linting. Biome, written in Rust, combines the functionality of tools like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (code formatter), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (linter), and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) into a single fast binary. Ultracite leverages Biome’s speed and capabilities, providing a preset of rules and settings tailored for modern TypeScript projects.
