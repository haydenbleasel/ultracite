title: Migrate from ESLint
description: How to migrate your project from ESLint to Ultracite.
---

If you're using ESLint and want to switch to Ultracite's preconfigured setup, this guide will help you migrate while maintaining code quality standards.

## Why Migrate to Ultracite?

- **Lightning Speed**: Biome (Ultracite's foundation) is based on Rust, much faster than ESLint
- **Zero Configuration**: Hundreds of preconfigured rules vs manual ESLint setup
- **Combined Tool**: Replaces both ESLint and Prettier with a single tool
- **AI Integration**: Built-in support for AI-powered editors (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript rules with strict null checks
- **Modern Standards**: Latest JavaScript/TypeScript best practices

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- An existing project using ESLint
- Node.js v14.18+ (Node 18+ recommended)
- A `package.json` file

## Migration Steps

### 1. Remove ESLint Dependencies

Remove ESLint and related packages from your project:

```package-install
npm uninstall $(npm ls --depth=0 --json | jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]' | grep eslint)
```

This command will remove all dependencies containing the word "eslint" i.e. plugins, presets, etc.

### 2. Remove ESLint Configuration Files

Delete your existing ESLint configuration files. These might include:

- `.eslintrc.js`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.eslintrc.yml`
- `.eslintignore`
- `eslint.config.js`

etc.

### 3. Update VS Code Settings

If you have ESLint configured in your `.vscode/settings.json`, remove any references to it. For example, you might have configuration like this:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "eslint.format.enable": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

### 4. Install Ultracite

Run the [automatic setup script](/setup#automatic-installation).

```package-install
npx ultracite init
```

This will:

- Install Ultracite as a dependency
- Merge your existing `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` with Ultracite's preset
- Merge your existing `.vscode/settings.json` with Ultracite's preset
- Enable `strictNullChecks` in your `tsconfig.json` file (or create one if it doesn't exist)
- Preserve your custom rules and settings
- Set up editor integrations

Following the upgrade, you may want to review your `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` file to remove any overrides. Additionally, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.

### 5. Update scripts in `package.json`

If you have ESLint related scripts in your `package.json`, you can replace them with Ultracite equivalents. For example, you might want scripts like this:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "npx ultracite@latest lint",
    "format": "npx ultracite@latest format"
  }
}
```

Your project should now be running with Ultracite's fast, comprehensive linting and formatting!
