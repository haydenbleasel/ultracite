title: Migrate from Prettier
description: How to migrate your project from Prettier to Ultracite.
---

If you're using Prettier and want to switch to Ultracite's preconfigured setup, this guide will help you migrate while maintaining code quality standards.

## Why Migrate to Ultracite?

- **Lightning Speed**: Biome (Ultracite's foundation) is based on Rust, much faster than Prettier
- **Zero Configuration**: Hundreds of preconfigured rules vs manual Prettier setup
- **Combined Tool**: Replaces both ESLint and Prettier with a single tool
- **AI Integration**: Built-in support for AI-powered editors (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript rules with strict null checks
- **Modern Standards**: Latest JavaScript/TypeScript best practices

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- An existing project using Prettier
- Node.js v14.18+ (Node 18+ recommended)
- A `package.json` file

## Automatic Setup

Run the [automatic setup script](/setup#automatic-installation).

```package-install
npx ultracite init
```

This will:

- Install Ultracite as a dependency
- Merge your existing `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` with Ultracite's preset
- Merge your existing `.vscode/settings.json` with Ultracite's preset
- Enable `strictNullChecks` in your `tsconfig.json` file (or create one if it doesn't exist)
- Preserve your custom rules and settings
- Set up editor integrations

Ensure you choose to remove the existing `Prettier` configuration. This will:

- Remove Prettier and any related dependencies
- Remove any Prettier configuration files
- Remove any Prettier related commands from your `.vscode/settings.json` file

Following the upgrade, you may want to review your `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` file to remove any overrides. Additionally, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to install step by step or use a specific package manager, follow these steps.

### 1. Remove Prettier Dependencies

Remove Prettier and related packages from your project:

```package-install
npm uninstall $(npm ls --depth=0 --json | jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]' | grep prettier)
```

This command will remove all dependencies containing the word "prettier" i.e. plugins, presets, etc.

### 2. Remove Prettier Configuration Files

Delete your existing Prettier configuration files. These might include:

- `.prettierrc.js`
- `.prettierrc.json`
- `.prettierrc.yml`
- `.prettierignore`
- `prettier.config.js`

etc.

### 3. Update VS Code Settings

If you have Prettier configured in your `.vscode/settings.json`, remove any references to it. For example, you might have configuration like this:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
}
```

### 4. Install Ultracite

Run the [automatic setup script](/setup#automatic-installation).

```package-install
npx ultracite init
```

This will:

- Install Ultracite as a dependency
- Merge your existing `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` with Ultracite's preset
- Merge your existing `.vscode/settings.json` with Ultracite's preset
- Enable `strictNullChecks` in your `tsconfig.json` file (or create one if it doesn't exist)
- Preserve your custom rules and settings
- Set up editor integrations

Following the upgrade, you may want to review your `biome.json` / `biome.jsonc` file to remove any overrides. Additionally, restart your editor to ensure the new configuration is applied.

### 5. Update scripts in `package.json`

If you have Prettier related scripts in your `package.json`, you can replace them with Ultracite equivalents. For example, you might want scripts like this:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "npx ultracite@latest lint",
    "format": "npx ultracite@latest format"
  }
}
```

Your project should now be running with Ultracite's fast, comprehensive linting and formatting!
